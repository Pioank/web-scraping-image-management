# web-scraping-image-management

This project is using Python web-scraping (Selenium & Beautiful Soup) to scrape both data and screenshot elements from the target page.

The images are stored in Cloudinary via their API and the reason behind this is because the results are later visualised on Power BI which will display images but only if they are served from another service via URL

The data scraped are promotions and the images are the landing pages. This project can provide rich data for competitors' analysis
